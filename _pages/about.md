I'm a 2nd year computer science master's student co-advised by the incredible [Ellie Pavlick](https://cs.brown.edu/people/epavlick/) and [Chen Sun](https://chensun.me) at Brown University. I also work with (Stefanie Tellex](http://cs.brown.edu/people/stellex/) and lots of other amazing people at Brown. Before that, I was advised by [Natalia Khuri](http://nataliakhuri.com/) in applications of natural language processing methods in biomedical domain.

Currently, my research area is mainly on natural language processing, particularly in its fusion with computer vision, and its interpretability and generalizability. I believe that incorporating multiple modalities is an important step towards general artificial intelligence.

Outside of research, I enjoy building lego and listening to music ([Charlotte Cardin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charlotte_Cardin), what a beautiful voice!).
