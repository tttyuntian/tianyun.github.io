Hi! I'm a Ph.D. student co-advised by the incredible [Ellie Pavlick](https://cs.brown.edu/people/epavlick/) and [Chen Sun](https://chensun.me) at Brown University. I also work with [Stefanie Tellex](http://cs.brown.edu/people/stellex/) and lots of other amazing people at Brown. Before that, I was advised by [Natalia Khuri](http://nataliakhuri.com/) in applications of natural language processing methods in biomedical domain.

Currently, my research area is mainly on multimodal learning, and model interpretability and generalizability. I believe that incorporating multiple modalities is an important step towards general artificial intelligence.

Outside of research, I enjoy building lego and listening to music ([Charlotte Cardin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charlotte_Cardin), what a beautiful voice!).
